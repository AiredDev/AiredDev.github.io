## Data definition types
**Atomic data**: data that can't be broken down into simpler pieces while still meaningfully being part of the same problem domain.
**Compound data**: a single data item that consists of multiple related values, like a person's first name, last name and telephone number.
**Enumeration**: a structure made of a fixed number of distinct values.
**Itemized data**: a structure where the data is comprised of two or more subclasses, in which at least one of the subclasses is not a distinct value.
